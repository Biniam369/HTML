        The universe is an immense and mysterious expanse that holds billions of
        galaxies, each containing stars, planets, and countless celestial
        bodies. Our solar system is a tiny yet fascinating part of this vast
        cosmos, consisting of the Sun, eight planets, moons, asteroids, and
        comets. From the scorching surface of Mercury to the icy rings of
        Saturn, every planet has its own unique characteristics. Scientists
        continue to explore the universe, uncovering its secrets and expanding
        our understanding of space, time, and the possibility of life beyond
        Earth.

      <h2>Galaxies: The Building Blocks of the Universe</h2>
      <p>
        Galaxies are vast collections of stars, planets, gas, dust, and dark
        matter bound together by gravity. They come in different shapes and
        sizes, ranging from massive spiral galaxies like the Milky Way to
        irregular and elliptical galaxies scattered across the cosmos. Each
        galaxy holds billions or even trillions of stars, many of which may have
        planetary systems like our own. Scientists have discovered millions of
        galaxies, each with its own unique structure and history, offering a
        glimpse into the origins and evolution of the universe. Some of the
        galaxies in our planet are listed below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Milky Way Galaxy</li>

        <li>Andromeda Galaxy (M31)</li>

        <li>Triangulum Galaxy (M33)</li>

        <li>Whirlpool Galaxy (M51)</li>
